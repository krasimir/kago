## How to deploy the watch face on your watch without the store

You'll need to build the watch face for the device by using Cmd+Shift+P in VSCode and choose "Monkey C: Build for Device". The result of that proccess you can probably find in the `dist` directory (under the `build_for_device`). You then will need a away to transfer the files from your Mac to the watch. Fenix 8 is using MTP protocol. [OpenMTP](https://openmtp.ganeshrvel.com/) is a good option. Copy a single file, the `.prg` file (in this case `Kago.prg`) to `/GARMIN/Apps` directory on the watch.
